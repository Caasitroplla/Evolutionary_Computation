# Evolutionary_Computation
Solving Air Crew Scheduling Problems using Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms

## Running the code

To run any of the algorithms individually, you can run the following commands:

```bash
python BGA_standard.py
python BGA_improved.py
python simulated_annealing.py
```

To run all the algorithms on each data set once, you can run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run all the algorithms on each data set multiple times, you can run the following command:

```bash
python testing.py
```

When this is run it will provide you with two graphs and the raw data stored in `results.json`.
